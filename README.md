# üåç FakeNewsWorldWide üì∞
**Genuine fake news for your reading pleasure**



## Have you ever been struck by how much of the news you read isn't fake??
Maybe not - regardless it's time we do something to fix that. This app will create fake news on demand using OpenAI's Davinci. 

None of this is new. 
There's a non-zero chance this project is a commentary on the dangers of LLMs... but that's also a pretty banal take.

I think the most interesting piece of this app may be the way to showcase news tied to locations on a globe (at least that's the goal)

Ideally, the app will look something like this:
